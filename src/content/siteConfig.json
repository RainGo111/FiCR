    "purpose": "FiCR supports the interoperable description, inspection, and assessment of both fire safety compliance and fire risk in existing buildings. It provides a semantic basis for rule based reasoning, risk informed analysis, and fire oriented digital twin applications across building operation and maintenance.",
